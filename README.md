# TopMusic

I made this project to get better with Python and Javascript, as well as gain experience with new (to me) technologies, including Django, MongoDB, and React.

I started out wanting to find a way to connect my last.fm data with the spotify data for each track, and I thought it would be a good project to create a web app out of what I was doing.

The project takes a user entered last.fm username, and scrapes their information to present it, as well as retrieve thje spotify audio data for the tracks in their library.
