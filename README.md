# TopMusic

I made this project to get better with Python and Javascript, as well as gain experience with new (to me) technologies, including Django, MongoDB, and React. I wanted to answer the question I've always had "How are complex websites really structured?", and I gained a lot of understanding of what goes into constructing a dynamic website.

## Description
I started out wanting to find a way to connect my last.fm data with the spotify data for each track, and I thought it would be a good project to create a web app out of what I was doing. The spotify data that is displayed is a collection of "audio features" that spotify uses to analyze music and find similarities to make playlists or recommendations. For example, Danceability is how "danceable" a track is, valence is how "angry" the song is, etc..

The project takes a user entered last.fm username, and scrapes their last.fm library information to present their top 50 artists/albums/tracks, as well as retrieve the spotify audio data for the tracks in their library. (The top 50 number is arbitrary and the program could easily be expanded to cover their whole library, but this would of course increase latency significantly)
